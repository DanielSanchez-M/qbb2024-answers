# Answers to Question 2.3

## Q1) Which feature appears to be under the highest level of purifying (negative) selection? How can you tell?

The exons (green line) appear to be under the highest level of purifying selection. This is evident from the fact that the enrichment of exons steadily decreases as MAF (Minor Allele Frequency) increases. The stronger decline in exon enrichment compared to introns, cCREs, and other features suggests that variants in exons are more likely to be subject to negative selection, likely because changes in these regions can disrupt gene function, leading to deleterious effects.

## Q2) Why do you think most features start out more enriched at lower MAFs and become more depleted as the MAF increases?

Features are more enriched at lower MAFs because rare variants are more likely to occur in regions that are functionally important, such as exons and cCREs, where selection acts to remove deleterious alleles. These regions play crucial roles in gene regulation and protein coding, meaning that SNPs in these areas are often under stronger purifying selection. As the MAF increases, the SNPs that persist are more likely to be neutral or less functional, as they are under weaker selective pressure. This leads to a reduction in their enrichment, as they become more common in the population, reflecting reduced selection pressure.

## Q3) Does the relative level of enrichment/depletion of features with respect to each other make sense? Explain.

Yes, the relative levels of enrichment and depletion make sense. Exons and cCREs (which are regulatory elements) show higher levels of enrichment at lower MAFs because mutations in these regions are more likely to be deleterious due to their direct impact on gene function or regulation. As a result, they are under stronger purifying selection. In contrast, introns and other less functionally constrained regions are under weaker selective pressure. These regions can tolerate more variation without significant functional consequences, which explains their relatively consistent levels of enrichment across MAFs.
