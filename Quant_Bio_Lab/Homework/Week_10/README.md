## What do each of these values mean, based on the descriptions of what is being labeled?

Each value shows the average fluorescence intensity in each channel for the labeled nucleus. The nascentRNA channel indicates nuclei with active transcription, while the PCNA channel marks nuclei with active DNA replication. The log2 ratio compares transcription to replication.

## Look at the knocked-down gene with the highest ratio and the one with the lowest ratio. Look up what their functions are and explain if you think this result makes sense.

The highest ratio of the knockdown genes was POLR2B which is an RNA polymerase involved in transcription. Thus, its knockdown should have caused a decrease in transcription levels which would mean the nascent RNA would have decreased meaning a smaller ratio should have existed here. There may be other elements involved to help compensate for this then.

As for the lowest ratio, PIM2 which is involved in the Cell Cycle should have had  a reduced PCNA due to reduction of DNA replication. However, that would have resulted in a greater ratio which is odd that PIM2 is reduced. Therefore, there may be other elements involved to help "resuce" the replication even without PIM2 present.
